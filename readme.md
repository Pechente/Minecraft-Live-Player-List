#About:

Minecraft Live Player List allows you display an online list of active players that currently play on your server or recently went offline. The website automatically stays up to date and plays a sound as soon as a new player joins your server. The current player count is also mirrored as a badge in the favicon.

The goal is to encourage a small player base to play together. Unlike most minecraft related web-sites, this one works with vanilla Minecraft and doesnâ€™t require you to install any mods on your server as all the required data is gathered from protocols and files that are provided by the game.

You can check out a [live version here](http://minecraft.rene-henrich.de/).

#Usage:

The script needs to run on the same system that runs your Minecraft server. Be sure to have 'server-query' set to 'true' in your Minecraft server settings. After uploading all the files, you need to change the permission of player-cache.json to 777 and adjust the settings in player-query.php and main.js. The script needs to access the /playerdata folder inside your Minecraft world folder.

After setup, I recommend to run /player-query.php?limit=20 in your browser before opening index.php since the script needs to cache the offline player names before it can operate properly. Caching the player names can take up to 2 seconds per player on the first launch, so adjust the request limit to fit your needs / patience.
