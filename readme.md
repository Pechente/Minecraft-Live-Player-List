##About:

Minecraft Live Player List allows you host a website that displays currently active players as well as an offline list of recent players. The website interface automatically stays up to date and plays a sound as soon as a new player joins your server. The online player count is also mirrored as a badge in the favicon.

The goal is to encourage a small player base to play together. Unlike most Minecraft server dependend web-sites, this one works with vanilla Minecraft and doesnâ€™t require you to install any mods on your server as all the required data is gathered from protocols and files that are provided by the game.

__You can check out a [live version here](http://minecraft.rene-henrich.de/).__

The current version works with Minecraft 1.8.X and is not likely to break with future updates.

##Usage:

The script needs to run on the same system that runs your Minecraft server. Be sure to have 'server-query' set to 'true' in your Minecraft server settings. After uploading all the files, you need to change the permission of player-cache.json to 777 and adjust the settings in player-query.php and main.js. The script needs to access the /playerdata folder inside your Minecraft world folder.

After setup, I recommend to run /player-query.php?limit=20 in your browser before opening index.php since the script needs to cache the offline player names before it can operate properly. Caching the player names can take up to 2 seconds per player on the first launch, so adjust the request limit to fit your needs / patience.
